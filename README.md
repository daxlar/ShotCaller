# ShotCaller
Gunshot Localizer made at MakeHarvard
Loosely based on failed ideas expressed in ProjectUno
Initally intended to be a gunshot triangulator but lack of resources limited me to create one localizer
Project meant for applications in situations of gun violence, such as high crime impoverished areas and school shootings
ShotCaller allows victims of school shootings know where the gun shot occurred in real-time and to escape in the opposite direction.
Similarly, in impoverished environments, ShotCaller is meant to increase the police response time to shootings
